Mission Statement
The purpose of the database system is to track inventory and orders of our Bagel Barnâ€™s deli in Princeton, New Jersey.

Through our analysis, Bagel Barn will be able to understand how to go about:
Selling their goods by looking at seasonal trends in their data.
Altering their menu to account for the popularity and relevance of their items over time.
Order inventory (ingredients) at the most optimal times to prevent food spoilage from lack of use.
Determining which suppliers to maintain relationships with and which to terminate relationships with.
Determining when to upgrade equipment.
Understanding customer preferences.

Mission Objectives

Create a database that has the tables: Orders, Customers, Suppliers, Goods, Ingredients, and Equipment.
Track inflow and outflow of ingredients and goods in stock.
Track how much of the ingredients and equipment are provided by each supplier.
Monitor good popularity and order frequency.
Report top 3 customers, suppliers, and goods based on quantity over the same year (seasonality).
Monitor the typical (average) shelf life of various ingredients.
